# polynomail_equation
Polynomial equation solver. Support operation like create variable, input(cin>>), output(cout<<), operator+, operators- and operators*.  
Example: Polynomial p1, p2, p3;
         cin>>p1>>p2;
         cout<<p1;
         cout<<p2;
         p3 = p1 + p2;
         p3 = p1 * p2;
         p3 = p1 - p2;
